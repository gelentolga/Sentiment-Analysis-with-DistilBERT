# Sentiment-Analysis-with-DistilBERT
This project solidified my understanding of NLP and deep learning techniques, preparing me for advanced machine learning challenges in academic and professional settings.

University Project | Master of IT

As part of my Master of IT program, I developed a sentiment analysis system using DistilBERT, leveraging the Hugging Face Transformers library and PyTorch. This project involved building a robust model to classify Amazon product reviews as either positive or negative, emphasizing practical applications of Natural Language Processing (NLP).

Key Contributions:

Data Preparation: Preprocessed large datasets of Amazon reviews by cleaning, tokenizing, and encoding text, ensuring high-quality input for the model.
Model Implementation: Fine-tuned DistilBERT, a state-of-the-art NLP model, to achieve accurate sentiment predictions. Leveraged PyTorch for model training, implementing efficient batching and GPU utilization.
Performance Optimization: Resolved challenges related to training speed and compatibility with GPU environments. Employed techniques like dynamic padding and early stopping for improved efficiency.
Deployment: Designed and deployed a user-friendly web interface using frameworks like Gradio, enabling real-time sentiment prediction for user input.
Outcomes:

The project resulted in a functional, accessible sentiment analysis tool capable of classifying unseen reviews with high accuracy. This experience significantly enhanced my technical expertise in machine learning and NLP, while also providing hands-on exposure to real-world challenges in model development and deployment.
